# quicksketch
Or slow sketch, if you'd prefer

An app designed to take images and display them at set intervals for figure drawing.

Will have class modes that let the user customize their own classes and set length modes where the user can set an image to display for whatever length they desire

Their will be the ability to flip the image

Still working on the specifications of the program. Don't even know what I will use to make it yet.
